DOCMENTATION FOR COMPUTER PROGRAMMING COURSEWORK

PROGRAM OVERVIEW
We designed a program to do the following:
	•Greet the user: Here we ask the user for their name and then greet them with a welcome message
	•Calculate birth year: We ask the user for his/her birth year to calculate their age using the birth year they have given us
	•Ask for favourite number and check whether it is even or odd: We ask the user to enter their favourite number between 1 and 20.
	•Conditional response based on his input: we display a message to the user telling them whether their favourite number is even/odd 	and whether it is less or greater than 10
	•Implement a Book class: We defined a Book class with attributes for title, author, and year of publication.
	•Sort books by year_published: We created a function to sort a list of Book objects by their year_publication.
	•Use of For and While loops to display book information: Use for and while loops to display book details.
	•Search for books: We created a While True loop to allow a user search for a book name in the book instances we created



CODE STRUCTURE AND EXPLANATION
Part A: Basic Python
	•Variable declaration: We declare Variables name, age and birth_year to collect user input in order to have a welcome message and 	calculate their birth year using the age they input.
	•Error handling: We use a try-except block to handle unexpected errors from the user in terms of data type used when inputting 	data. Ie Strings and integers in the wrong fields.

Part B: Conditional Execution
	•Error handling: We still use the try-except block to handle unexpected errors when the user uses a wrong data type in the field
	•Conditional statements: We use the if, else, and elif statements to make decisions based on the user's favourite number and 	determine whether it is odd/even and whether it is less, equals to or greater than 10.

Part C: Functions and Classes
	•Class definition: We defined the Book class with attributes (title, author, year_published) and a method (BookValue)to describe 	the Book Class.
	•Function definition: We created a function called books_sorted to organise a list of books sorted by the year_published.

Part D: Iteration Techniques
	•for loop: We use the for loop to list the book details.
	•while loop: We also use the while loop to list the book details.
